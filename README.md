# front-generator
My currently in work personal front-end architecture generator (React, Flux, ES2015/16, Eslint, SASS, ...). Use it to build an independent front-end architecture.


# Current Gulp tasks
- build
- build --watch
- build --prod

For development build just launch `gulp build` as development is the default mode.
This is just a security.
